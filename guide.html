<h2>Software Engineer Guide</h2>
<p>
    This guide is a personal initiative to deepen my knowledge as a backend
    developer. My focus is on exploring essential software engineering concepts,
    documenting what I’ve learned, and continuously improving my technical
    skills. It’s a way to track my progress, challenge myself, and stay on the
    path of growth in my career.
