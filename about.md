<p>I am a Java Developer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in building microservices with Spring Boot. My expertise includes RESTful APIs, microservices architecture, object-oriented programming, and clean code practices. I have hands-on experience with relational databases like Oracle and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, and I’m currently expanding my knowledge in Kubernetes, advanced Spring features, and secure software development.</p>
<p>Currently, I develop invoice query and submission applications for the financial sector, collaborating closely with business areas to deliver effective solutions. I am passionate about continuous learning, knowledge-sharing and contributing to improve my team's development standards.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the drums, gaming, reading, walking my dog, and practicing Taekwondo. These activities help me stay balanced, creative, and focused, fueling my dedication to both personal and professional growth.</p>
